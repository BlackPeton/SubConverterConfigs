# Quantumult uses HEAD method send HTTP request to the server_check_url to test the proxy's status, the results should be two latencies, the first one is TCP handshake to the proxy server, the second one is the HTTP latency(The duration between Quantumult successfully received the HTTP response from the server_check_url and Quantumult start sending the HTTP request to the server_check_url). The lightning icon means that the TCP fast open is successful. If the server in section [server_local] or section [server_remote] has its own server_check_url, its own server_check_url will be used instead of the server_check_url in section [general].
#
# Quantumult 使用 HTTP HEAD 方法对测试网址 server_check_url 进行网页响应性测试（测试结果为通过该节点访问此网页的 HTTP 延迟, 即 HTTP 响应时间与 HTTP 请求发起时间的差值），来确认节点的可用性。
# Quantumult 界面中的延迟测试方式均为网页响应性测试，显示的最终延迟均为通过对应节点访问测试网页的 HTTP 延迟。
# 由于 Trojan 协议为无响应校验协议，使得 HTTP 检测方式即使获得了 HTTP 响应，也不代表节点一定可用。
#
# The dns_exclusion_list contains the domains that disabled the placeholder IP(198.18.0.0/15) mapping mechanism. Domains that are not in the dns_exclusion_list have the placeholder IP mapping mechanism enabled and have the so called "resolve-on-remote" effect. The DNS query for domains in the dns_exclusion_list may or may not follow the settings in [dns] section.
#
# The enhanced_compatibility_ssid_list will be considered when global option 「Enhanced Compatibility」 is off in misc settings.
#
# The udp_whitelist contains the destination UDP port, empty means all the ports are in udp_whitelist. UDP packets(through Quantumult tunnel interface) with destination ports that are not in the udp_whitelist will be dropped and the ICMP(port unreachable) messages will be sent back. This setting has nothing to do with the filter rules or policies and has nothing to do with the proxy(server) port either.

# The udp_drop_list contains the destination UDP port, the mechanism is similar to the udp_whitelist dropping the UDP packets, but will not send back the ICMP messages. Only UDP packets allowed by udp_whitelist can be caught by the udp_drop_list.
#
# The traffic to excluded_routes will not be handled by Quantumult. It is better to reboot your device after modification.
#
# By default("loopback") when a domain rejected at DNS level the loopback IP response will be returned, you can change this behavior by setting dns_reject_domain_behavior to "no-error-no-answer" or "nxdomain" or "none". This will change the behavior to responding with NOERROR NOANSWER response or responding with NXDOMAIN response or none to disable the DNS level rejection feature. If you change the rejected domain to non-rejected(by changing configuration, filter or policy), it may take at most 10 seconds to take effect(TTL 10).
#
# The resource_parser_url sample can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossutility/Quantumult-X/master/resource-parser.js

# The server_check_timeout value will only be considered if it less than or equal to 5000 (milliseconds). This value is compared with the total duration of the checking process including the DNS query, TCP handshake, TLS handshake and the application layer HTTP session duration, so the total duration may significantly longer than the "TCP handshake" and the "HTTP session duration".

# The DNS servers fetched from current network(system) will always be used for better performance(you can disable this feature by using "no-system", but you should at least add one customized DNS server like "server=223.5.5.5").
# When no-ipv6 is set, the DNS module of Quantumult X Tunnel will directly let the AAAA query fail but still allow the A query from IPv6 DNS servers.
# The result of query will only be used for evaluating filter or connecting through direct policy, when connecting through server the result will not be used and Quantumult will never know the destination IP of related domain.
# When prefer-doh3 is set, the DoH query will try DNS over HTTP3, if it fails then the query connection will fallback to the HTTP2. Since the multiplexing are supported by HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections, when you change this setting, it might not take effect immediately but you can reconnect the Quantumult X Tunnel or manually change your network environment to let it take effect immediately.
# When doh-server (DNS over HTTPS) or doq-server (DNS over QUIC) is set, system and all other non-encrypted regular(no specific domains are bond to it) servers will be ignored. The default port for DoQ is 853, if there is a mutual agreement to use another port like 456 for your DoQ, you can set it as quic://dns.example.com:456
# Multiple(concurrent query) doq-server(s) or doh-server(s) should be configured in one line and the URLs should be separated by comma. When both doq-server(s) and doh-server(s) are set, the query will be sent to all of the servers simultaneously.
# If the iOS version is < iOS 13.0, the max number of doh-servers will be limited to 1. If the iOS version is < iOS 15.0, the max number of doh-servers will be limited to 2.
# Specially directly set 127.0.0.1 for a domain is not allowed in here. if you want some domain(eg: example.com) to be 127.0.0.1, just add "host, example.com, reject" to the "filter_local" section. The reject action will return DNS response with 127.0.0.1 to the query.
#
# The circumvent-ipv4-answer and circumvent-ipv6-answer are related to upstream DNS. If the A or AAAA result(IP) from upstream is matched by this field, the result will be ignored and marked as failed. If multiple queries sent to different upstream DNS servers, and the first responded upstream result is matched by this field, Quantumult X Tunnel DNS module will wait for other upstream servers' results.
# The ? and * can be used in circumvent-ipv4-answer and circumvent-ipv6-answer.
# If you are using ads related upstream DNS, please leave circumvent-ipv4-answer and circumvent-ipv6-answer empty.
